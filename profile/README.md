## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This space is a collection of terraform repositories dedicated to azure cloud.  
With the help of this codebase, it is possible to quickly create complete workloads  
using reliable, tested and production-grade modules.

### Principles:

* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is applied based on branch name.
* The [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification is enforced
* Before merging to the main branch there is required validation that must succeed.
* Release PRs are used to generate releases and tags.
* Various linting will be enforced.
* Each module contains multiple integration examples, which can be tested.
