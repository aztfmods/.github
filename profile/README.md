## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This space is a collection of terraform repositories dedicated to azure cloud.  

With the help of these repositories it is possible to quickly create complete workloads  
using reliable, tested and production-grade modules.

### Principles:

* Each module contains one or more logical resources grouped together.
* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used based on branch name.
* Before merging to the main branch there is required validation that must succeed.
* Release PRs are used to generate releases and tags.
* Various linting will be enforced.
* Each module contains multiple integration examples, which can be tested.
