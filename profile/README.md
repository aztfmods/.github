## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This space is a collection of terraform repositories dedicated to azure cloud.
After applying a framework like [caf enterprise scale](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale)
often teams want to work more independently on workloads and projects. In many cases the strategy is even
focused completely on innersourcing. This means teams are adopting open source processes in order to work
and collaborate more effectively. They open up the work internally between teams so that everyone can contribute
to the code. This is why there is a huge need to easily create workloads using modules.

### Principles:

* Each module contains one or more logical resources grouped together.
* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used based on branch name.
* Before merging to the main branch there is required validation that must succeed.
* Release PRs are used to generate releases and tags.
* Various linting will be enforced.
* Each module contains multiple integration examples, which can be tested.
