This space contains a collection of terraform repositories dedicated to azure cloud. With the help of this codebase, it will be  
possible to quickly create complete workloads using reliable, tested and production-grade modules.

This approach is ideal for teams that are adopting open source processes in order to work and collaborate more  
effectively using innersourcing strategies.

### Principles:

* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is applied based on branch name.
