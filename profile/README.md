## Personal ðŸ‘‹
Hi, i am a devops engineer with a preference to develop and use infrastructure as code principles. Spending all my time building cloud solutions in Azure using both declarative and imperative approaches. Enthusiastic about everything serverless, to minimise operations, so the primary focus will be mainly on development. I also like to blog and write about the challenges and solutions i encounter along the way.
